# Reflection-
This program is made to manipulate java bytecode. 
By setting path to jar file we can read classes from it, change bodies of their methods, 
add new methods, and even change hierarchy of classes. 
After read a jar file we need to specify class from this file to be modified. 
By default when creating new methods we can pass only these parameter types: String, float, int, double.
